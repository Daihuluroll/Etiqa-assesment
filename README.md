# Etiqa-assesment

This project is a small React app that will list the most-starred GitHub repositories created in the last 10 days.

Current status: Initial React + Vite scaffold created. Next steps will implement fetching from the GitHub Search API and infinite scroll.

Quick start (Windows / cmd.exe):

1. Install dependencies:

	npm install

2. Start the dev server:

	npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Notes:
- This scaffold uses Vite + React. Axios is included in package.json for later use when wiring the GitHub API.
- Follow-up tasks: implement the repository list, pagination/infinite scroll, and unit tests.
